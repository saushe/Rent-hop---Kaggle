# Penalized logistics regression, Random Forest and Bossting implimentaion
Recently I participated in Rent Hop cometition on Kaggle. Here is my code for data prep and model building. 

I have shown implimentation of *penalized logistics regression, Random Forest and Bossting* in R. `MLR` package has been used for tuning `XGBOOST`. I have also tried `SMOTE` to handle unbalanced data.
